# Getting Started

This page is for people looking to learn about autonomous vehicles or help us acheive our vision.

### Documentation
Our [documentation](http://docs.autoai.org/) is where we put all the things we learn about autonomous vehicles while we research them. We've written about much of the general knowledge we've obtained in our [knowledge base](http://docs.autoai.org/knowledge/). Technical information on our first prototype, The Cockroach, can be found [here](http://docs.autoai.org/cockroach/). If you have any questions for us, or if you'd like to contribute, don't hesitate to email us at [community@autoai.org](mailto:community@autoai.org).

### Website
If you're looking to help AutoAI and have web development skills, we can use your help. Our present website uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), a web framework which generates the site from markdown. This makes it easy for our engineers to make modifications but also presents challenges with formatting and embedding media. If you can help us with this, e.g. by making a custom template for MkDocs or by making a traditional site that's easy to modify, email us at [community@autoai.org](mailto:community@autoai.org).

# Getting Started

Right now we're not actively developing a vehicle (we'll be doing that this Spring), but we've still got some things we're working on.

### Documentation
Over the Summer we put a lot of time and effort into building our vehicle and not too much time documenting it. Because documenting our work is really the whole point of our organization, getting this done is a priority. Reach out to us via Slack about helping us, or if you're not part of our Slack, email us at [community@driveai.org](mailto:community@driveai.org).

### Website
This website is pretty nice, but we're looking to put our updates from earlier months as well as pictures and other information on the site. Again, reach out to us via Slack about helping us, or if you're not part of our Slack, email us at [community@driveai.org](mailto:community@driveai.org).

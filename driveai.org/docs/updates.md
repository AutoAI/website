# Updates

If you're looking to stay up-to-date with our goals and progress, you've come to the right place.

### December 2015
#### _Goals_
December is going to be another busy month for our student members with final exams approaching. We will, however, be holding a board meeting to discuss the direction we'll be taking in 2016. We'll also be reviewing our finances and creating a budget and presentation materials for another pitch to our primary sponsor, [Munich Reinsurance](http://www.munichre.com/en/homepage/index.html).

### November 2015
#### _Goals_
In November we'll be taking the opportunity to get ourselves organized while many of our members are busy with classes. In particular, we're looking to streamline the process by which we onboard new members and get them involved. To do this we'll be launching a new website for information about our organization and another website for documention.
#### _Results_
We launched the new website (the one you're viewing now), which will provide all the information people need to get up-to-date with our efforts. We also launched the documentation site [here](http://docs.driveai.org); documentation will be added continuously as our projects progress.

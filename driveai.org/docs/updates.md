If you're looking to stay up-to-date with our goals and progress, you've come to the right place.

### December 2015
#### _Goals_
This month, while many of our members are busy with finals, we're taking the opportunity to get ourselves organized. In particular, we're looking to streamline the process by which we onboard new members and get them involved. To do this we'll be launching a new website for information about our organization and another website for documention.
#### _Results_
So far, we launched this website, which will provide all the information people need to get up-to-date with our efforts. The documentation site should be live shortly, with documentation being added over the course of the next week or two.

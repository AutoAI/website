We've begun designing our next prototype, which will ideally consist of an actuated low-speed electric vehicle with lidar and software with a focus on localization. Low-speed electric vehicles and quality sensors tend to be cost-prohibitive, so we're launching a round of fundraising to help us realize our goal. We presently have the resources to build a vehicle, but not without sacrificing quality in some area of the design. A marginal amount of additional funding or a better deal on a significant expense should alleviate our constraints.\n\n\nJanuary 2016\n\n\nOver the winter, we spent some time exploring how we can both make the biggest difference in the coming year and move closer to our long-term goals. As we explored the idea of building an autonomous vehicle, we discovered that there was little information available to help us decide which sensors to purchase - in particular, we failed to find appropriate sample data from sensors (which would have allowed us to evaluate them for our needs or test data processing techniques). In addition, we had a discussion with the people at \nAuro Robotics\n, who expressed the need for an open-source localization and mapping solution. As a result, we decided that releasing datasets and solving localization and mapping related problems will be our primary goals in the near future.\n\n\nNovember 2015\n\n\nIn November we took the opportunity to get ourselves organized while many of our members are busy with classes. In particular, we streamlined the process by which we onboard new members and get them involved. As a part of this effort, we launched a new website for information about our organization (the one you're viewing now) and another website for documention \nhere\n.

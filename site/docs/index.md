# DriveAI

DriveAI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and development of autonomous vehicles. We're bringing the community together to understand and build autonomous vehicles in an open way.

### The Vision

Our goal as an organization is to hold regular meetings to discuss developments in vehicle autonomy, create resources for the general public to learn about vehicle autonomy, and build guides to help hobbyists and entrepreneurs development with autonomous vehicle development. We'll know we accomplished this when anybody can become comfortable and up-to-date enough with autonoumous vehicles to build their own.

### Our Story

Our first five members got together in Fall of 2014 because we were interested in the space and wanted to make a difference. By the following Spring, we had set up ourselves as a non-profit, and in May, we were funded by [Munich Reinsurance](http://www.munichre.com/us/property-casualty/home/index.html) and really got started.

This summer we built an autonomous go-kart which we affectionatley refer to as The Cockroach. It was built as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate simple path planning and software-hardware interation.

# DriveAI

DriveAI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and development of autonomous vehicles. We're bringing the community together to understand and build autonomous vehicles in an open way.

### Our Vision

Our goal as an organization is to hold regular meetings to discuss developments in vehicle autonomy, create resources for the general public to learn about vehicle autonomy, and build guides to help hobbyists and entrepreneurs development with autonomous vehicle development. We'll know we accomplished this when anybody can become comfortable and up-to-date enough with autonoumous vehicles to build their own.
